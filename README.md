# trsctr.github.io

A personal website built with **React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and React-Three-Fiber**.  

## Overview  

I created this project as a space to **learn, explore, and experiment** with modern web technologies. The site features:  
- A **GLSL shader-based animated background** for visual interest  
- An **interactive 3D mesh** using React-Three-Fiber and Drei  
- A **functional contact form**  
- A clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS  

## Future Plans  

I plan to expand this site to showcase my projects and explore new web technologies through continuous iteration.
